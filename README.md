# FPGA-Implementation-of-SM3
The hash algorithm of SM3 is implemented using Verilog. We've tested its functionality by deploying it in a typical blockchain system. **design_sm3(PYNQ-Z1).bit** and **design_sm3(PYNQ-Z1).tcl** are .bit and .tcl files generated for PYNQ-Z1 devices, and **design_sm3(ZCU104).bit** and **design_sm3(ZCU104).tcl** are generated for [ZCU104](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/zcu104.html) devices, which are all required to transfer to your corresponding FPGA platforms. In addition, **sm3_ip.c** is the Linux driver program written in C language for calling the IP core of SM3, and **sm3_ip.h** is the corresponding header file.
